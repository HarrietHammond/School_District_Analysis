## Charter and Public School Types


Pandas helped create a comparison between Charter schools and Public schools in terms of budget for each school type, total number of students per school and grades/scores. The reading and math scores were also calculated and the summary statistics were performed. Additional analysis can be performed on gender of students in the two school types and performance within different genders between the school types can be made.
